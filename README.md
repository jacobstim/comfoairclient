# ComfoAir Client
Reads &amp; analyzes data of Zehnder ComfoAir/ComfoD/WHR ventilation units, using the on-board RS232 port. I'm using this to read the air  temperatures on my ComfoD 450 unit. The RS232 port is located near the power/remote unit connectivity and exposes (in my case) the communication between the CC Ease control panel and the Zehnder unit.

Features:
 * Live data processing / raw data dump for serial port connections.
 * Can analyze serial dumps that you saved in another application
 
Should also work for other Zehnder units such as the ComfoD 250/350/450/550 series and new ComfoAir series, the WHR variants. Not tested on Paul units though.
